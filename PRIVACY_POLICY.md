**Privacy Policy for System Settings**

**Last updated:** 21 Jan 2026

**1. Introduction**

This Privacy Policy describes how the **System Settings** app ("we," "our," or "us") handles your information. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This app is a utility tool developed by olcane.com (package name: `com.olcane.systemsettings`).

**2. Data Collection and Use**

**We do not collect, store, share, or transmit any personal user data.**

The **System Settings** app functions solely as a shortcut to launch your device's native settings menu.

* **No Personal Information:** We do not ask for, access, or store names, email addresses, or phone numbers.
* **No Device Data:** We do not track your location, device ID, or usage statistics.
* **No Internet Access:** The app does not request the `INTERNET` permission and cannot transmit data to any external server.

**3. Permissions**
The app operates with the absolute minimum permissions required to function on the Android operating system.

* **Query Permissions:** The app uses the `<queries>` element in the Manifest to detect the existence of the system settings app on your device (`android.settings.SETTINGS`). This is a technical requirement for Android 11 (API level 30) and above and does not grant access to user data.

**4. Third-Party Services**

This app does not integrate with any third-party analytics (such as Google Analytics or Firebase) or advertising networks. It contains no third-party SDKs that collect user data.

**5. Children’s Privacy**

Since our app does not collect any data, it is safe for users of all ages. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13.

**6. Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted.
