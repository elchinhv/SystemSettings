# System Settings

**System Settings** is a lightweight Android utility application designed to provide quick and direct access to the device's native System Settings menu. It serves as a convenient shortcut, particularly useful for devices or launchers where the default Settings app is hidden or difficult to navigate to.

## 🚀 Features

* **One-Tap Access:** Instantly launches the Android System Settings (`Settings.ACTION_SETTINGS`).
* **Auto-Close:** The app automatically closes itself immediately after launching the settings menu, keeping your recent apps list clean.
* **Lightweight:** Minimal resource usage.
